# Pingcoin (Android)

**Description**:  Pingcoin is a sound-based counterfeit coin detector. When a coin is struck by another object it will resonate at its resonance frequencies, which are determined by a material and geometric properties. Because these properties vary quite largely among coins (although not absolutely) it is possible to cross reference a coin's acoustic spectrum with reference values available in the Pingcoin app.
